# Arth Panel: Lightning-fast. Intuitive. Capable.

The Arth Panel project, comprised of the [observer](https://github.com/ArthTechnologies/observer) frontend and [quartz](https://github.com/ArthTechnologies/quartz) backend, was started to reimagine the hosting and self-hosting experience from the **ground up**. Whlie other panels can be time-consuming, over-engineered and confusing for users who just want to get to playing Minecraft, Arth Panel aims to be intuitive while still being extremely capable.

## Does it really have all the features I need?
For over a year leading into this upcoming 1.0 release, this panel has been battle-tested with Arth Hosting. Almost everything that's necescary for hundreds of customers is already implemented:
- Users can create custom subdomains with cloudflare integration
- Users can create an account with discord or email/password.
- Cloudflare turnstile can verify accounts to prevent bots.
- A built-in file editor with renaming, zipping, unzipping, text editing, and more capabilities.
- SFTP access, albeit still in beta.
- Robust stripe integration for subscription payments.
- Modrinth & CurseForge integration for modpacks, datapacks, mods, and plugins.
